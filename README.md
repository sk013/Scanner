# Scanner

##################BasicPortScanner.py#################
it is the script to scan 1-1000 ports,,,,
whether they are open or closed,,,,
it is bit slow,,,

##################AvdPortScanner.py###################
for using this script you have to specify the host and the ports which you want to scan,,,,
its much faster,,,,

#################GrabBanner.py######################
it will grab the version/banner of services which are running on the open ports,,,, 
it scans 100 ports by default,,,,
